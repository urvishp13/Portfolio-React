            subjective creativityâ€”a skill necessary to make UI designs appeal to users. Engineering Logic has
            allowed Urvish the ability to remake overly complex UX designs into more
            practical interfaces for busy users. And Frontend Skills have provided Urvish the tools to
            utilize his past experiences to do what he loves: making web apps highly useable.
